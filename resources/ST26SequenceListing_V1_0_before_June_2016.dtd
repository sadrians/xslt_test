* INSD Part
*******************************************************************************

The purpose of the INSD part of this DTD is to define a customized DTD for
sequence listings to support the work of IP offices while facilitating the data
exchange with the public repositories.

The INSD part is subset of the INSD DTD v1.4 and as such can only be used
to generate an XML instance as it will not support the complete INSD structure.

This part is based on:

The International Nucleotide Sequence Database (INSD) collaboration.

INSDSeq provides the elements of a sequence as presented in the
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ-style flatfile formats. Not all elements are used here.

INSDSeq
Sequence data.
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDSeq  (INSDSeq_length,INSDSeq_moltype,INSDSeq_division,
               INSDSeq_other-seqids?,INSDSeq_feature-table?,INSDSeq_sequence) >

<!--INSDSeq_length
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDSeq_length  (#PCDATA) >

<!--INSDSeq_moltype
Admissible values: DNA, RNA, AA
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDSeq_moltype  (#PCDATA) >

<!--INSDSeq_division
Indication that a sequence is related to a patent application. Must be populated with the value PAT.

-->
<!ELEMENT INSDSeq_division  (#PCDATA) >

<!--INSDSeq_other-seqids
In the context of data exchange with database providers, the Patent Offices should populate for each sequence the element
INSDSeq_other-seqids with one INSDSeqid containing a reference to the corresponding published patent and the sequence identification.
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDSeq_other-seqids  (INSDSeqid?) >

<!--INSDSeq_feature-table
Information on the location and roles of various regions within a particular sequence. Whenever the element INSDSeq_feature-table
is used, it must contain at least one feature.

-->
<!ELEMENT INSDSeq_feature-table  (INSDFeature+) >

<!--INSDSeq_sequence
The residues of the sequence. The sequence must not contain numbers, punctuation or whitespace characters.
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDSeq_sequence  (#PCDATA) >

<!--INSDSeqid
Intended for the use of Patent Offices in data exchange only.

Format:

pat|{office code}|{publication number}|{document kind code}|{Sequence identification number}

where office code is the code of the IP office publishing the patent document, publication number is the publication number
of the application or patent, document kind code is the letter codes to distinguish patent documents as defined in ST.16 and
Sequence identification number is the number of the sequence in that application or patent

Example:
pat|WO|2013999999|A1|123456

This represents the 123456th sequence from WO patent publication No. 2013999999 (A1)
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDSeqid  (#PCDATA) >

<!--INSDFeature
Description of one feature.

-->
<!ELEMENT INSDFeature  (INSDFeature_key,INSDFeature_location,INSDFeature_quals?) >

<!--INSDFeature_key
A word or abbreviation indicating a feature.
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDFeature_key  (#PCDATA) >

<!--INSDFeature_location
Region of the presented sequence which corresponds to the feature.
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDFeature_location  (#PCDATA) >

<!--INSDFeature_quals
List of qualifiers containing auxiliary information about a feature.
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDFeature_quals  (INSDQualifier*) >

<!--INSDQualifier
Additional information about a feature.
For coding sequences and variants see the ST.26 main body document.

-->
<!ELEMENT INSDQualifier  (INSDQualifier_name,INSDQualifier_value?) >

<!--INSDQualifier_name
Name of the qualifier.
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDQualifier_name  (#PCDATA) >

<!--INSDQualifier_value
Value of the qualifier.
-->
<!ELEMENT INSDQualifier_value  (#PCDATA) >
